# Trip-Scheduling-App
A simple trip scheduling system in which an admin can
create trips between stations.

The Admin user functions are :
   * sign up
   * sign in
   * create a trip
   *  update a trip by id
   * delete a trip by id
   * show all scheduled trips
   * show all stations
   
The Trip Scheduling system frontend code uses Angular and backend apis
developed in java spring boot and MySql as a database.
